ANNOUNCEMENTS

1. My free dyno's died so https://dsaw-coin-price.herokuapp.com/ is dead as fuck. So I have uploaded the ```api.py``` for you guys to use. Host it on your own losers and add a PR. <3

2. Well my dyno's came back a week ago so yay, but if it dies again just wait for 4 days and it'll come back.I might give you guys the live database to play with but I know someone random bitch will fuck it up.
